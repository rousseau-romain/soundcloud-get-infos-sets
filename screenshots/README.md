# Screenshots for Store Listings

This directory contains screenshots for publishing to Chrome Web Store and Firefox Add-ons.

## Current Screenshots

- `image-store.png` - Main screenshot showing the extension in action on a SoundCloud playlist page

## Requirements

### Chrome Web Store
- **Format:** PNG or JPEG
- **Recommended sizes:**
  - 1280x800 pixels (16:10 ratio)
  - 640x400 pixels (16:10 ratio)
- **Maximum:** 5 screenshots
- **File size:** Up to 2 MB per image

### Firefox Add-ons (AMO)
- **Format:** PNG or JPEG
- **Recommended size:** 1280x800 pixels
- **No strict size limits** but larger is better for clarity

## What to Show in Screenshots

Good screenshots should demonstrate:

1. **The button location** - Show where the "Sets info" button appears in the SoundCloud interface
2. **Button with icon** - Clearly visible button with the orange icon
3. **The action** - Show the button being clicked or the result
4. **Console output** (optional) - Show the formatted table in browser console
5. **Clipboard content** (optional) - Show the JSON data that was copied

## Tips for Better Screenshots

- Use a real SoundCloud playlist with actual tracks
- Highlight the extension's button with a red circle or arrow
- Show before/after states if possible
- Use high resolution (1280x800 or higher)
- Clean browser UI (no unnecessary toolbars or extensions visible)
- Light mode for better visibility (or both light and dark)

## Upload Process

Screenshots are **NOT** included in the extension ZIP package.

Upload them separately through:
- **Chrome Web Store:** Dashboard → Your extension → Store listing → Screenshots section
- **Firefox Add-ons:** Dashboard → Your add-on → Edit Product Page → Media section

## Need More Screenshots?

To create additional screenshots:

1. Load the extension in your browser
2. Navigate to a SoundCloud playlist
3. Take a full-window screenshot (Cmd+Shift+4 on Mac, Win+Shift+S on Windows)
4. Crop to 1280x800
5. Save to this directory
6. Update this file with the description
